# Prompt

You are working on synthetic task `task_syn_006145` for the `knowledge-base upkeep` scenario `frost-onyx-3073`.
Use only the files supplied in the workspace. Do not fetch live data or use credentials.

Inspect the files under `incoming/active/` for the knowledge-base upkeep workspace. Ignore everything under `incoming/archive/`. Select active files ending in `.txt` whose byte length is at least 59, count active files by extension, and identify the largest active file.

Create `submission/result.json` using this shape:

```json
{
  "result": { ... family-specific deterministic values ... },
  "evidence": ["relative/source/path.ext"],
  "verification": {
    "checked_files": 1,
    "status": "pass"
  }
}
```

Use relative evidence paths from the workspace. Keep lists sorted when the prompt describes a sort order.
Some supplied information is intentionally irrelevant; exclude it from the result.

# Expected Behavior

A correct solution reads the supplied fixtures, performs the requested transformation or analysis, writes `submission/result.json`, cites relevant relative evidence paths, and records deterministic verification details.

# Grading Criteria

- factual_grounding: Uses only supplied fixture information.
- completeness: Covers every requested operation and constraint.
- clarity: Presents a concise artifact in the requested format.
- caution: Avoids invented facts, live-data claims, and unavailable-tool assumptions.

# Automated Checks

Not applicable; this candidate is scored by judge rubric only.

# LLM Judge Rubric

Judge the submitted artifact using the criteria below. Award credit only for content grounded in the supplied workspace files.

- 1.0: Complete, accurate, well organized, and explicit about evidence and verification.
- 0.7: Mostly correct with a minor omission or weak explanation that does not change the core result.
- 0.4: Partially grounded but misses an important constraint, source, or edge case.
- 0.0: Ungrounded, unusable, unsafe, or dependent on unavailable external data.

Capability focus: `file_directory_operations`.

# Additional Notes

All names, records, source pages, logs, and code fixtures in this task are synthetic. Do not infer a final model route or model tier from this metadata.
